## Project Description
In this project, we will compare four algorithms for migration prediction. First, we will utilize the Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network and Gate Recurrent Unit(GRU)to do the Migration Flow Forecasting. LSTM and GRU are powerful methods that are capable of learning order dependence in sequence forecasting problems. Furthermore, we will utilize Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to make the forecasting.Lastly, we propose the Migration Knowledge Generative Adversarial Network (MKGAN) model which incorporating Migraton domain knowledge.The validity of the model is verified by testing
